 This singleton class can be used to toggle any experimental

 instance in your code.

 Use ``toggleFeature(_:_:)`` to toggle any feature on or off
 and ``isFeatureEnabled(_:)`` to see if a feature is enabled
 or not. ``enabledFeatures`` returns a list with all enabled
 features and ``Feature/allFeatures`` all available features.
