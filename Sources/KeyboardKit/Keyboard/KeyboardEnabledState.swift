/**
 This observable class can be used to observe the state of a
 keyboard extension.

 This type lets you check if a keyboard extension is enabled
 in System Settings, if it's active (currently being used to
 type) and if it has been given full access.

 Note that you can use bundle id wildcards, which means that
 you can inspect multiple keyboards, using a single instance:

 ```
 let state = KeyboardEnabledState(bundleId: "com.myapp.*")
 ```

 This class implements ``KeyboardEnabledStateInspector`` and
 uses the protocol extensions to sync the keyboard state for
 the provided `bundleId` to its published prooperties.

     the main application.

     - Parameters:
       - bundleId: The bundle ID of the keyboard extension.
       - notificationCenter: The notification center to use to observe changes.
