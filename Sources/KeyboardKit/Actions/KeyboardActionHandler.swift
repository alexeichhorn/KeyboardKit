/**
 This protocol can be implemented by classes that can handle
 ``KeyboardAction`` events.
 
 Many views in the library use actions and an action handler
 to give you a flexible setup, where you can provide actions
 without having to specify how they are to be handled.
 
 You can trigger keyboard actions programatically by calling
 ``handle(_:on:)``. This is convenient when you must trigger
 actions from other parts of your keyboard.
 
 KeyboardKit will create a ``StandardKeyboardActionHandler``
 instance when the keyboard extension is started, then apply
 it to ``KeyboardInputViewController/keyboardActionHandler``.
 It will then use this instance by default to handle actions.
 
 Many keyboard actions have standard behaviors, while others
 don't and require custom handling. To customize how actions
 are handled, you can implement a custom action handler.
 
 You can create a custom implementation of this protocol, by
 either inheriting and customizing the standard class (which
 gives you a lot of functionality for free) or by creating a
 new implementation from scratch. When you're implementation
 is ready, just replace the controller service with your own
 implementation to make the library use it instead.
