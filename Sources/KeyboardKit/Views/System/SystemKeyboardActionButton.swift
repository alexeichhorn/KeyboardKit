/**
 This view mimics the buttons that are used in an iOS system
 keyboard. It wraps a `SystemKeyboardButton` view and uses a
 `SystemKeyboardActionButtonContent` to resolves its content.
 
 This view will adapt its content to conform to the provided
 `action` and `appearance` and applies keyboard gestures for
 the provided `action`, `actionHandler` and `context`.

 You can use the `contentConfig` to customize the content in
 the button to fit your needs.
 
 If you want to create a basic button, `SystemKeyboardButton`
 will create a view that looks like a system keyboard button,
 but that doesn't have any functionality.
