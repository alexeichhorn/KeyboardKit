# Styles

KeyboardKit defines a bunch of styles that simplify customizing the look of various keyboard components.


## Styles

KeyboardKit has a bunch of style structs that can be used to style certain views. Using styles gives you a flexible way of styling your views.

Almost all styles have a `.standard` style, that you can replace with a custom style to change the global style of that component.


## Appearance vs. style

The difference between appearances and styles, is that appearances are dynamic while styles are fixed. In KeyboardKit, views use an appearance if they need dynamic styling or generate views that need to be styled, while basic views just use a style.
