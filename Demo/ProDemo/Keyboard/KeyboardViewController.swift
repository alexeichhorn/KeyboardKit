/**
 This keyboard demonstrates how to create a keyboard that is
 using `SystemKeyboard` to mimic a native iOS keyboard.
 
 The demo makes demo-specific configurations in `viewDidLoad`
 and registers a custom view in `viewWillSetupKeyboard`.
 
 The keyboard registers a Pro license to unlock all keyboard
 locales, then applies either LTR or RTL locales based on if
 you are using the `Keyboard` or `KeyboardRTL` keyboard. The
 keyboard lets you change locale with a separate button, and
 remembers the current locale.
 
 To use this keyboard, you must enable it in system settings
 ("Settings/General/Keyboards"). It needs full access to get
 access to features like haptic and audio feedback.
 
 Note that this demo adds KeyboardKit as a local package and
 not a remote package, as you would normally do. It makes it
 possible to change things in the library directly from this
 project instead of having to push changes to GitHub.
