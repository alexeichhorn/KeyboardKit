/**
 This keyboard demonstrates how to create a keyboard that is
 using `SystemKeyboard` together with a custom input set and
 a custom keyboard layout.

 The keyboard makes demo-specific configurations and sets up
 the keyboard with a ``KeyboardView``. You can change all of
 these configurations to see how the keyboard changes.

 To use this keyboard, you must enable it in system settings
 ("Settings/General/Keyboards"). It needs full access to get
 access to features like haptic and audio feedback.

 Note that this demo adds KeyboardKit as a local package and
 not as a remote package, as you would normally add it. This
 is done to make it possible to change the package from this
 project and make it easier to quickly try out new things.
